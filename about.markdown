# About Me

Hey there. I'm a software developer in Charleston, South Carolina. You've made it to my developer blog, where I write
articles about things I've learned and record information I find useful or interesting.

## What is this blog?

This is a place for me to record things I find interesting. A lot of developers will write blog posts on Medium
or Dev.to, but I chose to host a simple blog here to allow me to record leanings or things I find interesting without
needing to polish them into more public posts. It's always possible that I'll choose to move one of these over to a
more public arena.

## My background

I'm native to Oregon. I went to [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) for a 
[bachelors](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academics/undergraduates/electrical-computer-engineering) and 
[masters](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/current-students/graduate/ece-program) in
[Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/).
I worked at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/) in Beaverton Oregon (just outside of Portland)
on [next generation ARM cpus and systems-on-chip (SoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Denver),
before moving to Charleston, South Carolina and changing career paths a little bit.

I began working at [Snagajob](https://www.snagajob.com/about/), specifically the
[PeopleMatter](https://www.peoplematter.com)
team, as a senior software engineer in 2017. I'm now working
as a member of the [JobBoard.io](https://www.jobboard.io) team at 
[ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/hiring/technology).
